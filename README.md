## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use `schema.sql` to create table.
- Use `data.sql` to populate table with sample data.
- Check `queries.sql` for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. 
  
  **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL server installed and running.
- psql installed
- A database to use
